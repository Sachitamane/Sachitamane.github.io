    <h1><em><strong>Real Life Elevator Example</strong></em></h1>

  <ul>

  <li>The issue with this design is that the users will get confused if the numbers are     buttons or if the side panel are the buttons</li>

  <li>But in reality the white light is the button</li>

  </ul>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <h3><em>Why is it good or bad &ndash;</em></h3>

  <ul>

  <li>Bad: the buttons are confusing</li>

  <li>Good: it has braille letters to aid anyone who is blind

  <ul>

  <li>the spacing between the buttons is good and easy to understand</li>

  </ul>

  </li>

  </ul>

  <h1><em>Most Common Features of an Elevator</em></h1>

  <ul>

  <li>

  <h3>most common uses in elevator:</h3>

  <ul>

  <li>buttons for different floors</li>

  <li>buttons for closing and opening doors</li>

  </ul>

  </li>

  </ul>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <ul>

  <li>

  <h3>most rare uses</h3>

  <ul>

  <li>call button</li>

  <li>bell button</li>

  <li>panel which accesses the controls</li>

  </ul>

  </li>

  </ul>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <ul>

  <li>this interface makes it easier to find the buttons regarding floors and door open and close button</li>

  </ul>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <ul>

  <li>the common sequence that a user will perform is:

  <ul>

  <li>find the button regarding floor they want to go</li>

  <li>to and press the button</li>

  <li>but for this specific interface it can be a bit confusing since it isn&rsquo;t clear exactly which one is the button</li>

  <li>the user will have to use trial and error to find the button</li>

  <li>first by pressing the number</li>

  <li>and then maybe the flat panel on the left</li>

  </ul>

  </li>

  </ul>

  <ul>

  <li>the interface provides feedback using light and sound, the button lights up red and we hear a sound</li>

  <li>one of the biggest current mistakes is that the buttons are not intuitive</li>

  </ul>
